Schedule downlink (FPort 1)
NOTE: if you want dowlink to put device to sleep, use this payload format and command:
Payload Type: Bytes
  Byte 0: 0x5A (magic number) 
   - Why 0x5A? 0x5A is a nice binary number, '0101 1010', 
     and it's easy to recognize.
  Byte 1: Command 
  Byte 2-5: Value

Commands:
  0x01: Set sleep time
  0x02: Set send delay
Example:
0x5A 0x01 0x00 0x01 0xD4 0xC0 -> Set sleep time to 120000ms (2 minutes)
